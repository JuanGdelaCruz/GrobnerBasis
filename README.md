# GrobnerBasis
Library for computing Gröbner Basis in .NET using Buchberger´s algorithm. Includes sample application that checks if a given graph is k-colorable using the API.
Developed for my bachelor´s project. (see http://oa.upm.es/63155/ ).

# Usage example
Given a polynomial ring in R with two variables, named *x* and *y*, that is *R[x,y]*.
```
            Ring r = new Ring(Field.Real, new string[] { "x", "y" });
```
Fixing *y>x* with the lexicographical order.
```
            r.FixOrder(new string[] { "y", "x" });
            r.Order= MonomialOrder.lex;
```
And given the following polynomials in the ring:
- f1: *xy -x*
```
            Polynomial f1 = new Polynomial(r);
            f1.AddTerm(1, new int[] { 1, 1 });
            f1.AddTerm(-1, new int[] { 1, 0 });
```
- f2: *-y +x^2*
```
            Polynomial f2 = new Polynomial(r);
            f2.AddTerm(-1, new int[] { 0, 1 });
            f2.AddTerm(1, new int[] { 2, 0 });
```
The ideal generated by *f1* and *f2* is:
```
            Ideal I = new Ideal(new Polynomial[] { f1, f2 }, r);
```
Which has as minimal Gröbner basis:
```
            var minimal = I.MinimalGröbnerBasis();
```
Being the reduced Gröbner basis:
```
            var reduced = I.ReducedGrobnerBasis(); 
            
```
We can also verify if a polynomial belongs to the ideal:
```            
            I.Member(f1);
```
